# Connect4ArtificialIntelligenceJava
A Java program  that uses the minimax algorithm to play connect four. 

Developed this program my senior year of college during my Artificial Intelligence class.
It was designed to compete in connect four with my classmate's programs. 
The program was able to consistently place first and was the best overall of the class.

How to play:
Currently the program is set up so that a small connect four table will appear on the terminal. 
Enter a number to play your move, the AI will shortly play its own. 
The game will end until a player connects four.
